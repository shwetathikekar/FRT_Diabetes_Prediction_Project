# FRT_Diabetes_Prediction_Project
Future Ready Talent [Microsoft] Internship Project -  Diabetes Prediction Project 

diabetes.csv is used in the project and source of it is from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database/data

The general workflow of the project is as follows:

        Importing Libraries
        Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
        Data Visualization
        Correlation between all the features
        Scaling the Data
        Model Building
        Random Forest
        Decision Tree
        XgBoost classifier
        Support Vector Machine (SVM)
        The Conclusion from Model Building
        Feature Importance
        Saving Model â€“ Random Forest
        Conclusion
